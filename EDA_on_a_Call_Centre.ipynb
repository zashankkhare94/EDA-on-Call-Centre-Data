    "RBS Board has hired services of Brent Associates to audit its accounts and the auditors have sought pay-out details to CallIn PLC. You are working with Brent Associates as data analyst and have been called in the team to render your services and investigate inconsistencies, if any. All information was tallied but the pay-outs given to CallIn PLC for the month of February 1999 were suspiciously incorrect and hence your major task is to audit this information and assess if payout has been accurately done and state exchequer has not been cheated upon. \n",
    "\n",
    "As per historical records, the RBS Team at CallIn PLC constituted of following team in February 1999: \n",
    "\n",
    "●\t8 agent positions\n",

    "●\t1 shift-supervisor position\n",
    "\n",
    "●\t5 agent positions for internet services (in an adjacent room) \n",
    "\n",
    "The team operated for:\n",
    "\n",
    "●\tDuring weekdays (Sunday to Thursday), the call centre is staffed from 7:00am to midnight. \n",
    "\n",
    "●\tDuring weekends (Friday-Saturday), it closes at 14:00 on Friday and reopens at around 20:00 on Saturday. \n",

    "Below is the summary of compensation structure that was contracted between RBS and CallIn PLC in effect during the month of February 1999:\n",
    "\n",
    "●\tFixed Charges: This is the fixed amount a minimum of which will be billed to RBS by CallIn PLC. This is non-negotiable and non-deductible even under the provisions of applied penalties (Refer later part of this section on clarification of penalties applicable on CallIn PLC).\n",

    "o\tMonthly third-party usage charges: This amount is charged in lieu of fixed third party vendors on boarded by CallIn PLC on behalf of RBS including but not limited to Cloud Telephone Services, Internet Connections, Network Maintenance and Server Maintenance Fees, Equipment AMC etc. This flat fee is EUR 20,000/ month\n",
    "\n",
    "●\tVariable Charges:\n",
    "\n",
    "o\tVRU Call charges: These relate to the usage of VRU facility by RBS customers:\n",

    "\n",
    "●\tQueuing of customers: RBS does not want its customers to wait in queue for unreasonably long periods. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "o\tQueue time <= 1 minute per call is not penalized \n",
    "\n",
    "o\tQueuing time > 1 and <= 3 minutes is penalized at EUR 0.5/ minute. \n",

    "\n",
    "o\tEvery customer that hangs up the call/ disconnects the call due to non-availability of agents is charged at EUR 10/ instance. These can be found by the calls where outcome is “AGENT” and server is “NO-SERVER”. \n",
